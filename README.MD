## About SPAR

**SPAR** was created to document fight choreography without breaking flow. It was designed for performers who need to take notes one-handed while holding a weapon in the other. The tool is fast, repeatable, consistent, and optimized for the unique demands of stunt performance.

---

## Purpose

SPAR is intended to streamline fight choreography documentation, enabling stunt teams to:

- Record fight sequences in a structured spreadsheet.
- Track individual fighter moves including footwork, hands, weapons, and stage directions.
- Export spreadsheets for rehearsal notes, production records, or archiving.
- Work seamlessly on mobile devices during live rehearsals.

## Free Use

SPAR is free for anyone to use. Feedback, stories, and encouragement are always appreciated. Donations are welcome but optional.  

If your team would like to collaborate or have a **custom version** of SPAR tailored to your workflow, we are open to working with other stunt teams to build specialized tools. Reach out to discuss your needs — we love collaborating on custom solutions!
